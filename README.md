# ChatBot using Python 

This is a simple chatbot which can answer our basic question's. 

It take's input from the user and is scored against all example sentences which is stored in the `intents.json` file. And it is then trained using neural network which will help us identify the intent with the highest score as the intent for this input, if it is above the configured thresholds.

Made by using Python and Tensorflow library.

Took help from Youtube. 

And was made in collaboration with Promit Bhar.
## Deployment

To deploy this project first create and activate a python virtual environment.

Followed by installation of `tensorflow`,`numpy`,`nltk` and all other dependencies, then choose which intent file you want to use `intents1.json` or `intents2.json` and make changes accordingly with your file path in the open function in both `chatbot_interface.py` and `main_scripts.py` files.

 First run the `main_scripts.py` file then `chatbot_interface.py` file 

For more detail's refer to Google.
